# Duck-Orion-v2.5-Accessories

My personal files for the Duck Orion v2.5 accessory pieces. All of these are modified original Duck files, with the exception of the inner weight and the side triangle thing, which I didn't change at all.

I've added screw holes for the outer weight, and I've hacked together the files for the acryllic diffusers. I've used the Orion v3 files and adapted them to the v2.5. The front diffuser was slimmed and some funny cuts for LEDs and other PCB components were removed. For the back diffuser, I took the v3 file, mirrored it, spaced them apart to the same width as the bottom housing (measurements taken from the Orion v2 file) and connected them.

All of these files already have tolerances applied to them and should fit without issue. Inner and outer weights need countersunk holes. I've included a file with both acryllic accessory pieces together, which should save some money during laser cutting.
